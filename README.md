# geant4help
Here i'm going to create information resource for Geant4 studying (in Russian)

I wanna share my knowledge and experience in field of computer modelling using Monte Carlo methods and Geant4 toolkit.
Because when I started I faced with a lack of materials in Russian so I had to learn English, ahah

So if you don't want to read Geant4 documentation or watch youtube videos (all in English), you will be able to use this website soon.
Meybe you will find something interesting there for your scientific life
